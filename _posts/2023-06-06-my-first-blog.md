#### On June 4, 2023 I completed what no other man named Christopher Javier Zamora has ever completed...the Chicago Half Marathon brought to you by the Bank of America. The reality is that numerous individuals have completed half marathons at some point in their lives. However, I'm uncertain if anyone has fulfilled the specific criteria mentoined earlier. How many Christopher Javier Zamora's do you know that have completed the Chicago Half Marathon brought to you by the Bank of America?
