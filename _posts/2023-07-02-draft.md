### Dirty Laundry
#### Laundry, the not-so-glamorous duty bestowed upon us as a rite of passage into adulthood. No longer can we rely on dear old Mom or Dad to wash and fold our unmentionables. As an Associate Laundress turned Senior Laundress Consultant, I've gained valuable insights during my 7-year journey. Here are some of my seasoned opinions

### The Iron vs Steamer
#### Every day, I face the dilemma: should I iron or steam this garment? It's usually straightforward when I can check the care label for instructions. However, things get tricky with thrifted shirts that lack care labels. Honestly, who has the time to research every piece of clothing? Not me, I'm a busy dude! So, when I'm getting ready for a night out, I often wonder: iron or steam? If I opt for steaming, my shirt might end up damp. If I choose ironing, I risk getting some water on my pants. Sure, they'll dry eventually, but no one wants to put on a damp shirt or pants that scream "oopsie!" You know what's even worse? The risk of burning my hand with both devices. So, here's the simple solution, bro: throw your stuff in the dryer. No chance of burns, and in this automated age, let the robot handle it all. Embrace the convenience.

### Washing
#### Feel free to call me whatever you want. I have a different approach to laundryâ€”I wash my whites and colored clothes together. Personally, I find the idea of separating colored clothes as racist. Are you are afraid of "staining" your white clothes because you mixed in some color? Oh brother, give me a break! Next you are going to tell me you don't support interracial marriages. Challenge the status-quo, mix them together, and infuse your life with excitement, flavor, and a hint of risk

### Hats
#### Hats are a fire accessory that adds a stylish touch to any outfit. As I'm currently growing out my hair, a hat or beanie has become a staple in my daily fits. However, I used to struggle with washing hats. In my quest for automation, I would often toss them into the washing machine. Unfortunately, this led to broken bills and the loss of some of my favorite hats. With a big head that doesn't fit into most hats, I've built up a collection of 20+ hats, but only a handful are in regular rotation. So, how do I wash them? I've found a simple solution: I soak them in a tub of OxiClean, rinse with water, and allow them to air dry. It's a method that keeps my hats clean and intact. YA WELCOME!

### Folding
#### I don't think I can give advice on this. Hopefully in my next promotion as a laundress I obtain this skill. All I know is that this issue points back to the iron vs. steamer debate. Regardless of how you fold your clothes, you will need to remove the wrinkles. How the hell do you fold clothes?
